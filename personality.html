        <hr / color="#14213D">
        <p>
          My strongest <strong>personality trait</strong> is my agreeableness.
          This fosters excellent teamwork and collaboration skills, making group
          projects and discussions a smooth process. My willingness to cooperate
          and accommodate different perspectives creates a harmonious learning
          environment. Additionally, my agreeable nature often leads to strong
          relationships with other students. <br>
          My <strong>main hobby</strong> is playing instruments/making <a class="music" href="#vid-container">music&#127929;</a>.
          Beyond being able to express myself in an artistic way, music cultivates analytical
          skills as I decipher complex compositions and rhythms. This
          heightened cognitive ability translates into sharper problem-solving
          and critical thinking in my academic pursuits. Moreover, my
          dedication to creating music not only hones my discipline and time
          management but also provides an outlet for self-expression,
          contributing to a more balanced and focused approach to my studies.

            “Humility is recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn. 
            To learn is to die voluntarily and be born again, in great ways and small.” –<NAME>, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson
          </i>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Jordan B. Peterson is a Canadian clinical psychologist and media personality.
          I see Dr.Peterson as my hero because carries a profound understanding of the struggles 
          that plague young individuals, especially men, and shares an unyielding commitment to guide them towards a path of 
          purpose and strength. It's in his words that I find solace and direction, a way of thinking 
          that transcends mere advice, delving deep into the core values that shape a person's 
          character. Peterson's dedication to lifting the burdens of the youth resonates with me 
          on a fundamental level. Through his teachings, he inspires
           me to navigate life with integrity, resilience, and a sense of responsibility.

          <h5>ACCURACY:</h5>
          <p>
            I think this test is relatively accurate. It surprised me most when it listed the 
            career path I'm best suited for and I was in agreement with all, the fact 
            that I am actually pursuing one it listed. The test states I am more introverted than the 
            opposite, and in fact I am.
