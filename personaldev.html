        <hr / color="#14213D">

          <strong>&bullet;Chapter 4: <i>Achieve Your Goals</i> </strong><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          In light of this text, I've learnt it is important to recognize the
          value of taking charge of my own development and establishing specific
          goals. The chapter emphasizes the need of constant work and gradual
          development in achieving long-term success. The analogy of caring for
          a garden also offers a useful comparison to cultivating relationships
          and personal growth. This discussion between Michael and Charlie
          provides important insights on goal-setting ideas and the
          transformative power it possesses for someone like me pursuing
          personal and professional fulfillment.
        </p>

          <strong>&bullet;Chapter 5: <i>The Proper Use of Time</i> </strong
          ><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          In this chapter, Charlie reminds me of the choice between discipline
          and regret, urging me to value each day. He emphasizes the need to
          prioritize important tasks over urgent ones and stresses the
          importance of designing my own life plan. As I leave to attend to
          work, I thank Charlie for his wisdom and promise to visit again soon,
          appreciating the valuable insights he shares from Mr. Davis. This
          encounter leaves me with a renewed sense of purpose and a commitment
          to make the most of my time.
        </p>

            >&bullet;Chapter 6:
            <i>Surround Yourself With the Best People</i> </strong
          ><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          In this chapter, Charlie was busy cleaning the pool, demonstrating his
          dedication to even the smallest tasks. Charlie then imparted crucial
          wisdom about the significance of surrounding oneself with the right
          people, those who inspire and push towards success. Charlie's advice,
          though tough to digest, struck a chord. It's evident now that my
          choice of associations will significantly influence my path to
          success. Charlie's wisdom is shifting my perspective and catalyzing
          positive change in my approach to life's journey. This chapter
          underscores the profound effect our associations can have on our
          pursuit of success.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>&bullet;Chapter 7: <i>Be a Life-Long Learner</i> </strong
          ><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          In this chapter, Charlie emphasizes the importance of being a lifelong
          learner, introducing Mr. Davis's next Pillar of Success. He emphasizes
          that formal education alone isn't enough for success; self-education
          through continuous learning is crucial. Charlie stresses the value of
          reading books, noting that they open doors to new ideas, perspectives,
          and knowledge. Despite Michael's initial skepticism, Charlie insists
          on the transformative power of reading. He provides Michael with a
          list of recommended books, with "The Magic of Thinking Big" being the
          starting point. As the chapter concludes, myself, like Michael leaves Twelve
          Pillars with a newfound appreciation for learning and a warm regard
          for Charlie, who has become a mentor figure in his life.
